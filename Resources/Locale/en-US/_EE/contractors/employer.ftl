employer_name_nanotrasen = NanoTrasen
employer_name_nanotrasen_command = NanoTrasen Command
employer_description_nanotrasen = You are a NanoTrasen employee assigned to the concession station in the Gray Zone. The corporation built the infrastructure, covers housing, insurance, and labs, and expects you to meet the expansion targets. Instead of directives from Central Command, you receive profit KPIs, inspections, and bonuses for exceeding plan. Corporate Oversight and the plenipotentiary monitor every decision; reporting follows NT regulations, and any dispute quickly escalates into a legal audit. Loyalty and discipline are the currency for your next promotion.

employer_name_government = Government Service
employer_name_government_command = Government Service Command
employer_description_government = You are a state officer seconded to the station to represent the law and control the concession. The Captain, Head of Personnel, law enforcement, and the magistrate corps are appointed through the legislature and still answer to the governor, even if NanoTrasen covers part of their budget. Your job is to balance federal directives, the station council, and corporate profit goals: process paperwork, conduct hearings, command your department, and keep the ledgers ready for the next audit.

employer_name_contractors = Contractors
employer_name_contractors_command = Contractors Command
employer_description_contractors = You are a contractor working for a private firm granted operational control over entire departments. Your company runs engineering, medical, logistics, or service divisions, supplying equipment and personnel while meeting concession payments and revenue targets. In return you maintain insurance, keep reactors stable, move cargo, and defend the firm's interests on the council floor. Your contract is your lifeline-reputation, negotiation, and readiness to operate under any conditions determine how long you stay on the station. Example partners:
    TraumaTrust (medical outsourcing and MEDEVAC insurance). Their care packages mandate regular health audits and deploy field clinics for preventive treatment.
    Arclight Systems (engineering and energy infrastructure). They maintain schematics for every critical system, keep spare modules on reserve, and schedule emergency engineering shifts.
    Voidway Logistics (freight corridors and express delivery). The firm oversees shuttle routes, cargo labelling, and insurance coverage for each shipment.
    LumenCare Hospitality (services, housing, and VR leisure). The company sets service standards, manages cleaning drones, and maintains the station's VR leisure suites.
