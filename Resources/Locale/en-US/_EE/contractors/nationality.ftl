 NanoTrasen believes in you. Whether you hail from the glittering Central Sphere, the industrial Second Sphere, or the restless frontier, the station offers a chance to build the life you imagined.


nationality_name_central-sphere = Native of the Central Sphere
nationality_description_central-sphere =
 The Central Sphere is the heart of human civilisation-an expanse roughly fifty light-years across anchored by Earth, Mars, and Alpha Centauri. Floating megacities and neon-soaked streets sit atop arcologies enforced by corporate law. Order, luxury, and surveillance are inseparable, and every citizen lives under networks of invisible rules.

 The elite live above the clouds in hanging gardens and glass towers. Below them stretch dense districts choked with smog, where industrial noise never fades and clean air is a subscription. Resources flow endlessly through the Sphere, but the cost is borne by distant colonies whose labour the broadcasts carefully ignore.

 Extensive education programmes create administrators, analysts, and managers; yet outside the Sphere those skills rarely translate without corporate backing. Many leave in search of purpose, hoping to build something meaningful beyond the boardrooms that spurned them.

 For these expatriates, NanoTrasen sells the station as a fresh start: a chance to wield high-grade technology, regain status, or simply breathe without permission. The contracts are strict, but the promise of freedom-however regimented-pulls them away from the suffocating glow of the Core.


nationality_name_second-sphere = Second Sphere
nationality_description_second-sphere =
 The Second Sphere spans worlds between fifty and one hundred light-years from Sol. Once it symbolised progress, but the gleam has faded. Industrial planets packed with domed cities, orbital factories, and shipyards now run on outdated infrastructure barely maintained by overworked crews.

 Citizens grow up around assembly lines, cargo ports, and inherited corporate debt. Families pass down obligations alongside apartment blocks, and local media trades in nostalgia for prosperity that never arrived. Many residents dream about an escape from the endless shifts under rust-stained sky domes.

 That hunger for change makes NanoTrasen's offer compelling: leave the grinding machine of the Second Sphere and bring your discipline to a frontier project with modern equipment, hazard pay, and a chance to prove your experience still matters.


nationality_name_the-third-sphere = Third Sphere
nationality_description_the-third-sphere =
 Beyond the Second Sphere lies a patchwork of colonial ventures known as the Third Sphere. Terraforming projects lie half-finished, corporate towns cling to fickle sponsors, and entire settlements vanish when funding dries up. Infrastructure arrives late-if it arrives at all.

 Survival here demands adaptability, frugality, and the ability to rebuild with whatever can be salvaged. Third Sphere citizens rely on mutual aid, improvised supply chains, and the stubborn optimism that next cycle's shipment will land on time.

 Contracting with NanoTrasen is often the safest gamble. The corporation offers transport, steady work, and a modicum of stability. In return, colonists bring hard-earned resilience and a willingness to do what needs to be done, no matter how rough the conditions.


nationality_name_frontier = Frontier
nationality_description_frontier =
 The frontier stretches beyond official charts: asteroid belts hollowed into homesteads, drifting stations welded together from scrap, and agrarian communes orbiting nameless dwarfs. No central government oversees these systems; reputation and practical skill decide who gets to stay.

 Frontier inhabitants improvise for a living. They patch hulls in vacuum, barter for fuel filters, and print replacement organs in backrooms. Their law is pragmatic: help your neighbours, keep the air and water flowing, and repay kindness in kind.

 NanoTrasen treats them as ideal troubleshooters. Station life might feel cramped, but it offers stocked tool rooms, reliable power, and crews that appreciate a technician who can keep things running when the handbook stops making sense.


nationality_name_mining-station = Mining Station
nationality_description_mining-station =
 You grew up under the rumble of drills and ore crushers. Mining stations orbiting gas giants or anchored to asteroids are claustrophobic, loud, and perpetually coated in dust. Children learn to read shift schedules before storybooks and celebrate whenever the oxygen scrubbers outlast their maintenance window.

 Life revolves around yield quotas and maintenance rotations. EVA competence, emergency triage, and exosuit etiquette are second nature. Recreation is utilitarian: zero-g gyms, stale holo-vid archives, and the occasional improvised concert in a cargo bay.

 To NanoTrasen, you are trusted labour-someone who understands pressure hulls, bulk transport, and the art of squeezing efficiency out of industrial equipment. The corporation provides better quarters and safer tooling, so long as the ore keeps moving.


nationality_name_agricultural-station = Agricultural Station
nationality_description_agricultural-station =
 Agricultural stations are floating ecosystems. Columns of hydroponic towers, algae vats, and climate domes keep entire sectors fed. Residents balance nutrient flows, gene-edited crops, and relentless sanitation while fighting equipment failures that can wipe out a harvest overnight.

 Daily life blends biology and logistics: pruning grafted orchards in one hour, recalibrating pollination drones the next. Festivals revolve around successful yields, and everyone shares responsibility for keeping disease out of the airlocks.

 NanoTrasen values this expertise. On the station, agricultural backgrounds oversee kitchen vats, botany labs, and supply chains that keep crews healthy. Your sense of stewardship and vigilance against contamination make you the backbone of sustainable operations between resupply runs.


nationality_name_scientific-station = Scientific Station
nationality_description_scientific-station =
 Scientific stations orbit anomalies, nebulae, or black-site laboratories. Residents grow up surrounded by experiment schedules, containment seals, and ethics briefings. Curiosity is encouraged-but only after the safety checklist is complete.

 Time is measured in research cycles. Families gossip about peer review, share lab breakthroughs over dinner, and treat security clearances like heirlooms. Emergencies range from unexpected energy spikes to the occasional organism that should have stayed sedated.

 NanoTrasen positions its main station as the logical next step. Here you gain better funding, broader datasets, and crews who respect protocol. In return, the corporation expects you to bring meticulous methodology to every wing that needs it.


nationality_name_trade-hub = Trade Hub
nationality_description_trade-hub =
 Trade hubs are nebula crossroads stacked with cargo piers, arbitration courts, and layers of customs offices. Citizens negotiate before they walk, speak half a dozen pidgins, and treat market volatility as background noise.

 Life revolves around manifests and shipping routes. Day-night cycles blur into the glow of docking lights, and quiet corners are rare luxuries. Diplomacy, conflict resolution, and a talent for spotting scams are the survival tools of choice.

 NanoTrasen hires trade hub natives to keep supply chains smooth, defuse disputes, and spot opportunities before competitors do. The station may be smaller than a metropolitan dock, but the stakes-and the commissions-are higher.


nationality_name_military-base = Military Base
nationality_description_military-base =
 Military bases forge people in regimental rhythms: dawn drills, tactical simulations, and inspections that can strip a bunk bare in minutes. Whether planetary or orbital, they prize hierarchy, readiness, and loyalty above all else.

 Graduates of these installations can field-strip equipment blindfolded, coordinate squads under fire, and maintain discipline in the face of chaos. Off-hours culture is tight-knit-mess hall stories, sparring leagues, and memorial walls for those who never rotated home.

 NanoTrasen counts on this dependability to safeguard high-value assets. Security posts, emergency response teams, and command support all benefit from professionals who have already lived through worst-case scenarios and still show up for the next briefing.
